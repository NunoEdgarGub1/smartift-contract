# Smart Investment Fund Token (SIFT)
SIFT is an investment fund that uses volume spread analysis within cryptocurrency markets to increase in value.  It comes off the back of years of experience of the Smart Trader software that has traditionally been used for forex and commodity trading.

The smart contract that backs SIFT is exposed here for the world to see as part of our commitment to openness and transparency within our organisation and technology stacks.  SIFT will be made generally available as an ERC20-compliant token via an ICO.  For more details please visit http://smartift.com.
